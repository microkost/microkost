### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Ivo and I am an IT infrastructure specialist. I use a lot of private Github repositories to manage my Infrastructure as Code and other automation templates, but that you cannot see here. 

The rests are my free-time projects or university assignments. I am a hobby developer.
